    Here is a library filters preview. <br/>
    <br/>
    CSS canvas shows how browser's
    filter property works. Library generates this property and applies to
    canvas.<br/>
    <br/>
    JS canvas shows JS part of filters. They are transforming image and
    as a result, you get modified image. So, in CSS case, canvas will not
    really update image, it only applies filter to some area of browser
    window (e.g element), but JS really does it.<br/>
    <br/>
    As you can see, JS canvas updates only after input was changed (onchange
    called), but CSS canvas is updating while you are sliding the thumb (oninput
    called). The reason is there will be some stutters while updating
    canvas with JS, due to some images have really a lot of pixels and
    transformation will take some time, so you will see the stutters.<br/>
    <br/>
    In production, it is recommended to apply CSS filters first if you want to
    show what will happen, when you apply filter and then, when you want to
    download image, you have to apply JS part.
